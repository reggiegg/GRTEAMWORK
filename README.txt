For teams, rough breakdown of work: We pair programmed the whole thing - we both typed
and looked over each others shoulders offering encouragement.




What's your favorite programming language keyword (reserved word, that
is)?  Reggie - transient - from Java, it sounds like a hobo.
      Graham - Î» - because it's sort of rubbery in your mouth to say.





Give a simple test case for your interpreter that ensures that it uses
eager evaluation semantics.  (Your test case may not rely on the
amount of time it takes the interpreter to run.)

(test/exn (interp (parse '(with (x y) 1))) "")





Reggie potentially got Graham sick during the completion of the assignment.
